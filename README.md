# Web Archiving - Memento Counter

This project was created for an assignment for the Old Dominion University course 
CS 432 - Web Science in the fall of 2021. 

This project collects and processes tweets to their final URI-R's(given that twarc2 is set up on a machine, and that the user
has a Twitter Developer account). It was written in a way that it will only store unique URI-Rs so that there are no repeats. The final memento count from each unique URI-R is displayed via scatter plot that is created
through use of the Seaborn library.
